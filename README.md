# PDFconverter
A lightweight Python script that automatically combines multiple PDF files in natural order (e.g., page1.pdf, page2.pdf... page10.pdf) into a single document. Simply place your PDFs in the same folder and run the script to generate "combined.pdf". Uses PyPDF2 for reliable merging with human-friendly numbered sorting.
